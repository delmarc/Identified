==========

Someone where I work was like TDD is great... and I was like yea its a cool approach and its interesting as to how it makes you start to think differently and all this mumbo jumbo... but then we started to talk about writing tests that is code and I started thinking of code that writes code... and from there things got kinda nutty...

I am an engineer, not a boring developer... I don't think people understand it but there is a difference...
